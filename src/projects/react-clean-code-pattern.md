### Summary

React Clean Code Pattern is a light-weight project that demonstrates _the clean, reusable, and maintainable_ way of managing data/state in React application using Context API and Custom Hooks.

### Description

This project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to scaffold the React application and to simulate the server for API calls, JSON-server is used which is a fake REST server. To give an app a cool feeling, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used in the project.

_Concept Demonstrated:_

- Use of React hooks such as useState, useEffect, useReducer
- Creation of reusable custom hook by combining the core React Hooks.
- Use of Context API to pass context data down the children components and avoid props drilling

### Personal Growth

Through this project, I got to enhance my react skills by learning how different core concepts of React can be implemented as a whole in a project to manage the data & state in the app in a clean and reusable way.
