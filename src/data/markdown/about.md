## About

Hey — I’m Ajeet.

I’m a Software Engineer with 5+ years of commercial experience building and maintaining long-lived, production systems across consulting and enterprise environments. I had been building software well before entering industry, with early foundations shaped through study and hands-on work — a craft I’ve stayed deeply engaged with over time.

I enjoy working on software where the challenge isn’t just shipping features, but making sound decisions that hold up as systems, teams, and requirements evolve. Much of my background has been in consulting, working across multiple teams and domains, which has shaped how I think about trade-offs, ownership, and building software that works in real-world conditions.

## What I Work With

Most of my recent commercial experience has been centred around a TypeScript-first stack, and that’s where I’m most effective.

- **Frontend:** TypeScript, React, Next.js, Vue, Nuxt
- **Backend:** Node.js, NestJS, GraphQL, REST
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Buildkite)
- **Quality:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing (Jest, Cypress, Playwright)

These are the tools I’ve spent the most time with in production, but I’m more interested in choosing the right approach for the problem than being tied to any specific technology.

## What I’m Looking For

I’m interested in Senior Software Engineer roles where I can work on meaningful problems, contribute to well-structured systems, and help teams build software that remains reliable and maintainable as it grows.
